                            <li>Velocity. At the end of the day, everyone has the same goal: to get the project done and delivered. You want to do this as fast as possible. </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Builds blame culture: everyone will be trying to blame everyone else for bugs that are found because it will affect their review </li>
                            <li>Encourages people not to take responsibility. If you do accept responsibility (it's my bug) then you get penalised </li>
                            <li>Hurts inter-team relations. Developers and testers don't usually get on, but can you imagine the animosity the developers will feel towards testers if every bug a tester finds effectively damages a developer in their review.
                                </li>
                            <li>Slows velocity and costs more. Each spec is going to need to be written in huge detail or the developers won't touch it. There will be a massive increase in developer testing in order to ensure there are no bugs (and this probably
                                won't work anyway). </li>
                            <li>Risk-averse culture. Nobody will want to try anything new because new means risky. Forget about new techniques, new technologies, new organisational mechanisms. </li>
                            <li>Flight to safely. Nobody will want to work on the "hard" parts of the system because they will be more likely to introduce bugs. Everyone will want to write the admin screens, nobody will actually want to code the core functionality.
                                </li>
